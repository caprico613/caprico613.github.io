				<hr style="width: 400px;" />
				<p>In the first year of high school, I had a special travel to Japan. Since I had only been in 3 months, new environment and new friends were unfamiliar for me. At that time, I met my best friend, Zhuang. In an occasional conversation, Zhuang told me that he had a family travel to Japan and asked me whether to come with him. I searched for my parents’ permission. Surprisedly, they agreed, and this result also shocked Zhuang.  Both of us never believe our parents would agree. Out of our expectation, my adventure began.</p>

				<p>Our plan was to travel around Osaka. I arranged a schedule to go skiing around Lake Bika. In March, our plane took off. This was the first time I had been to Japan and second time taken a plane. I was excited and a little bit nervous while being on the plane. After arriving at Osaka International Airport, something embarrassing happened. Although I was with my friend’s family, I was alone officially. While passing the customs, I walked in front of the officer alone and the officer kept asking the man behind me to come here. It seemed that he misunderstood we were together. The ridiculous scenery that I tried to stop the stranger and the officer tried to convince him to come at that time was a little bit funny from the present perspective.</p>

				<p>On the third day, since Zhuang’s mom didn’t want to ski with us, the three of our high school students had to go there in person. The conductress on the bus spoke all Japanese during whole journey, so I was over the moon when hearing someone else spoke Mandarin too. They are couple from Hunan, and helped us a lot for borrowing the skiing equipment. Never did I then believe that such an international skiing resort did not have any English version of the documents. The documents were all in Japanese! Finally, we got our equipment, and took cable car to reach the mountain. I had to say skis were not for me. Maybe next time, I should try the snowboard. I was very weak to manipulate the skis and my legs. My legs trembled out of my control. So, I sneakily wandered around the coacher and tried to learn some skills from him. However, my skill still did not improve, and I had experienced near-death twice while skiing down the mountain. I almost fell off the lane and approached the 70 degrees side slope. Despite such a horrible experience, I still like skiing and snowing, so after returning to Taiwan, I went to the Taipei Arena to skate. That is another story...</p>

				<h1 style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">一次特別的旅行經驗</h1>
				<hr style="width: 400px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
				<p>剛上高中第一年，我有一趟前往日本的經驗。由於剛上高中三個月，所以新環境和新朋友對我來說很是陌生。那時我遇到了我最好的朋友Zhuang。在一次偶然的交談中，Zhuang告訴我說他有計畫前往日本家庭旅遊，問我是否要跟他一同前往。我向我父母尋求一同前往的許可。令我驚訝的是，他們同意了，這個結果也震驚了Zhuang。畢竟我們倆從未相信我們的父母會同意這件事。</p><br/>
				<p>我們的計劃是環遊大阪。我計畫了去琵琶湖滑雪的行程。三月初，我們的飛機起飛。這是我第一次去日本，也是人生中第二次坐飛機。搭乘飛機時，我既興奮，卻也有點緊張。到達大阪國際機場後，發生了令人尷尬的事情―儘管我和朋友的家人在一起，但正式說起來我還是一個人。通過海關時，我獨自走在海關面前，海關誤解了我與後面的陌生男子的關係並不斷要求我來這裡。從現在的角度來看，當時我試圖阻止陌生人和海關試圖說服他的荒謬景像有些荒誕有趣。</p><br/>
				<p>第三天，由於Zhuang的媽媽不想和我們一起滑雪，我們三個高中生只好自己想辦法前往。而車掌小姐在整個旅程中都講日語，所以當我聽見車上有其他人也說中文時我高興極了。他們是一對來自湖南夫婦，他們在這趟旅途幫助我們了許多，尤其是協助我們租借滑雪裝備，令我驚訝的是，一個國際滑雪勝地竟沒有英文版本的文件，這些文件都是全日語的！最終我們乘坐纜車到達了高山。我不得不說我非常不會使用雙板滑雪板，且我的腿經常發抖無法控制。所以我偷偷地在教練周圍徘徊，試圖從他那裡學到一些技巧。但是，好像並沒有太大的作用。而在滑雪下坡時我經歷了兩次瀕死體驗，當時我差點掉出滑坡道，並十分靠近70度側坡。儘管經歷如此恐怖的經歷，但我仍然喜歡滑雪和下雪，所以回到台灣後，我去了台北小巨蛋嘗試滑冰。而那又是另一個故事了...</p><br/>
