		Autobiography<br/>
		Hi, I’m Chris, or you can call me Yon-Gjun Hou in Chinese. I was born in Chiayi. There are five people in my family. My brother was studied in department of Optometry and had already graduated. As for me, I study in EE, Electrical Engineering, and I’m a senior right now.<br/>
		Briefly, use one sentence to describe my personality, “Never regret the consequence of what you did, but regret why you never did.” This is my life motto. I’m an extroverted person in private life; however, there’s no chance, if you won’t start a conversation. So, don’t be shy to start talking with me.<br/>
		In terms of the independent study, our theme is "Reconfigurable Modular Robot Motion Control” and is divided into hardware and software groups. The instructor is Dr. Wei-Yu Chiu. The software team is responsible for the development of algorithms. We use genetic algorithms to select excellent genes and hybridize the excellent genes to get a better next generation. The hardware team is responsible for turning modular robots that were originally developed only on software into reality, and try to make the hardware use different sensors to learn the environment. In the hardware team, I am responsible for designing the hardware code and handling the communication problems between the software end and the hardware end.<br/>
		If you want to know more about me, the following are my experiences.
